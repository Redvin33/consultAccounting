# consultAccounting
Easy way to handle accounting for consult businesses. I was doing accounting software for one small company and decided to do REST api on top of it for practice. 

# Instructions
You need to have postgresql server installed in your computer. You can download it here https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-windows/ .
 Also you need maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html .Then you need to open db_example.properties in /src/main/resources and edit there your database information. Initurl is just localhost:PORT
and tableurl is where you want the program to make its database.

# Documentation

REST API's documentation can be found on /src/documents/swagger.json
